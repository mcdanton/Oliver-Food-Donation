# Oliver

##Description
After an event, caterers and other food vendors often have a lot of food leftover. Unfortunately, without a simple alternative, these vendors usually end up throwing most of the extra food away. Oliver's goal is to help fight hunger by connecting food vendors with leftover food to local food banks. This offers a conveninent way for food vendors to give away excess food while providing food banks with a much needed supply of extra food. Together, we can make hunger a thing of the past.
